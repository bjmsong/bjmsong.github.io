## Introduction
- Throughout the course, students will design and build from scratch a complete deep learning library, capable of efficient GPU-based operations, automatic differentiation of all implemented functions, and the necessary modules to support parameterized layers, loss functions, data loaders, and optimizers.

## Assignments and project
- an introductory homwork
- four major homework assignments 
    - build a basic deep learning library, comparable to a very minimal version of PyTorch or TensorFlow, scalable to a reasonably-sized system (e.g., with fast GPU implementations of operations)
- a final project
    - an implementation of a substantial new feature within the developed library, plus an implementation of a model using this feature (than runs under the developed library not, e.g., done within PyTorch/Tensorflow)

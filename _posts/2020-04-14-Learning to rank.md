### Introduction

- Many IR problems are by nature ranking problems
  - document retrieval, collaborative filtering, key term extraction, definition finding, important email routing, sentiment analysis, product rating, and anti Web spam
- Learning-to-rank: learn how to combine predefined features for ranking by means of discriminative learning



#### Ranking in IR

- Conventional Ranking Models for IR

  - Query-dependent models
    - Boolean model 
      - based on the occurrences of the query terms in the documents
      - can only predict whether a document is relevant to the query or not, but cannot predict the degree of relevance
    - Vector Space model(VSM)
      - documents and queries are represented as vectors in a Euclidean space
        - TF-IDF
      - similarities: the inner product of two vectors 
    - Latent Semantic Indexing(LSI)
      - 
  - Query-independent models
    - PageRank

- Query-level Position-based Evaluations in IR

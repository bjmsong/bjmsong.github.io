## 1 Motivation: Why You Might Care
- 1.1 Simpson's Paradox
    - causality is essential to solve Simpson’s paradox
- 1.2 Applications of Causal Inference
- 1.3 Correlation Does Not Imply Causation
    - association： statistical dependence

## 2 Potential Outcomes
- 2.1 Potential Outcomes and Individual Treatment Effects
    - potential outcome Y(t) denotes what your outcome would be, if you were to take treatment t.
    - individual treatment effect (ITE)： Y(1)-Y(0)
- 2.2 The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference
    - we can‘t observe both Y(1) and Y(0),  then we cannot observe the causal effect Y(1) − Y(0)
    - This problem is unique to causal inference
- 2.3 Getting Around the Fundamental Problem
    - 


## 3 The Flow of Association and Causation in Graphs
